# CS465-Fullstack Development with MEAN

**Architecture**

•	*Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).*

The Express frontend renders HTML pages and handles routing on the server, while Angular runs in the browser as a single-page application (SPA). Express reloads pages on each request, but Angular dynamically updates views with client-side routing for smoother and fasting interactions. 

•	*Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?*

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB for it’s flexibility, scalability, and ability to store unstructured travel data as JSON documents.
---
**Functionality**

•	*How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?*

JSON is a data format that transmits information between the frontend and backend. JavaScript runs logic in the browser, and JSON allows MongoDB to populate Angular views. 

•	*Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.*
---
**Testing**

•	*Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security.*

I used Postman to test and verify GET and PUT endpoints. The /api/trips was tested with JSON data to confirm successful database updates. After that, Angular’s HTTP client was used to confirm frontend interaction.

**Reflection**

•	*How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?*

I gained an incredible amount of knowledge throughout this course, which felt like a capstone experience. It was deeply rewarding to see everything I’ve learned come together in one cohesive, full-stack project. Along the way, I had several breakthroughs with different programming languages and technologies. A big part of that was the JavaScript skills I honed while working on the Angular frontend. 

My journey in computer science began back in 2017, when I tackled my first course learning about HTML and CSS. Revisiting those technologies after years of study and practice was both nostalgic and eye-opening because I was able to see just how far I’ve come. Completing this full-stack project has solidified my interest in pursuing a job that focuses more on the backend and I’m excited to continue exploring how multiple technologies can come together to build integrated applications like the Travlr Getaways Project.
